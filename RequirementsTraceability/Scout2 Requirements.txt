Background
For over a decade, CCHR Sacramento has used software to evaluate bills that are before the California legislature.  There have been three versions of this software – Coyote, Circus and Scout.

Coyote was designed for use by someone other than the developer.  Circus was not and the first version of Scout was not.

Scout2 is intended to 
* be usable by someone other than the developer, and
* be extensible/repairable by someone other than the current developer.

Scout2 is being prepared for eventual hand-off.  As of this writing, hand-off is not imminent.

Goals & Objectives
There are two roles with needs to be addressed.  Those roles are user and developer.

User needs:
* The software must be easily accessible.  This may mean that it is available on AWS or another platform.  It may mean that it is available for download or other distribution.  It may mean both.  That needs to be established.
* The software should automate as much of the process as possible.
* A user’s guide
* A guide on evaluating legislative bills

Developer needs:
* These requirements
* Design documentation
* Test cases
* Source code
Business Case
I won’t be here forever.
Assumptions
In Scope
* Platform: Windows or AWS, depending on survey results
* Language: C# because that’s what Scout1 is written in and because it is well known
* Reports: On demand, creates canonical individual report for bill, allows editing
* Reports: On demand, generates weekly report from database and individual bill reports
Out of Scope
* Platform: Linux, Azure, etc.
* Language: C++, Rust, Python, etc.
Constraints
Constraints such as time, budget, resources, tools and environments
