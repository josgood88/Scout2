<b>Title</b>: AB-3285 (Irwin) Medi-Cal: antipsychotic drugs.
</p>
<p>
<b>Summary</b>: (Reviewed 3/7/2020)
   <br /> (Quotations taken directly from the bill's language, or from current code)
   <br />
   <br /> This bill would 
   <br /> 1. prohibit requiring prior authorization for an antipsychotic drug to treat the serious mental illness of a Medi-Cal enrollee for 365 days after the initial prescription has been dispensed
   <br /> 2. require automatic approval of an antipsychotic drug to treat the serious mental illness of a Medi-Cal enrollee if the department verifies a paid claim that documents a diagnosis of a serious mental illness within 365 days before the date of that prescription
   <br /> 3. exclude an antipsychotic drug to treat serious mental illness from the Medi-Cal programï¿½s limit of 6 drugs per month
   <br /> 4. allow a pharmacist to dispense a 90-day supply or early refill of a prescribed antipsychotic drug if specified criteria are met.
   <br />
   <br /> In other words,
   <br /> 1. Starting with initial prescription, no further prior authorization required for a year
   <br /> 2. Once any "serious mental illness" medication payment made for an enrollee, any other antipsychotic drug must be approved
   <br /> 3. No limit on number of drugs enrollee can be taking
   <br /> 4. Large batches may be dispensed
</p>

   <b>Position</b>: Oppose
   <br /> This makes it easy for psychiatrists to prescribe large amounts of psychotropics to Medi-Cal enrollees.
