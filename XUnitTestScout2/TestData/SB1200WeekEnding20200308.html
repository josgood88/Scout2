<b>Title</b>: SB-1200 (Jones) Mental health services grants.
</p>
<p>
<b>Summary</b>: (Reviewed 3/1/2020)
   <br /> (Quotations taken directly from the bill's language, or from current code)
   <br />
   <br /> "The Department of Rehabilitation shall establish a grant program for local jurisdictions that are enforcing 
          quality of life violations with the goal of diverting people who are experiencing homelessness and who are 
          in need of mental health services from the legal system to mental health services."
   <br />
   <br /> "Grants may be awarded only to local jurisdictions that can demonstrate enforcement of quality of life misdemeanors."
          Since SB1200 doesn't define who makes the decision to arrest/divert and what the diversion criteria are, routing to mental health becomes arbitrary.
   <br />
   <br /> A few examples of "quality of life misdemeanors", taken from California Code.
   <br /> California Penal Code 314 PC - Lewd or obscene conduct; indecent exposure. ("Every person who willfully and lewdly, either: [1]. Exposes his person, or the private parts thereof, in any public place, or in any place where there are present other persons to be offended or annoyed thereby
   <br />
   <br /> California Penal Code 370 - Anything which is injurious to health, or is indecent, or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property by an entire community or neighborhood, or by any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin, or any public park, square, street, or highway, is a public nuisance.
   <br />
   <br /> California Penal Code 640
   <br /> d)  
   <br /> (1) Willfully disturbing others on or in a system facility or vehicle by engaging in boisterous or unruly behavior.
   <br /> (3) Urinating or defecating in a system facility or vehicle, except in a lavatory. However, this paragraph shall not apply to a person who cannot comply with this paragraph as a result of a disability, age, or a medical condition.
   <br /> 
   <br /> California Penal Code 647
   <br /> (a) An individual who solicits anyone to engage in or who engages in lewd or dissolute conduct in any public place or in any place open to the public or exposed to public view.
   <br />  (c) Who accosts other persons in any public place or in any place open to the public for the purpose of begging or soliciting alms.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Position</b>: Oppose
   <br /> Another instance of the state flowing money to psychiatry.
   <br /> This bill does not
   <br /> 1) Address informed consent
   <br /> 2) Define who can divert a homeless person to mental health treatment
   <br /> 3) Define the framework for this diversion -- when is it considered appropriate?
   <br />
   <br /> (16 Mar 2020) "SB 1200 Senate Health Oppose" letter writing is in progress.
</p>
<b>ShortSummary</b>: Grant program, "quality of life" enforcement, homeless "who are in need of mental health services" diverted to mental health.
