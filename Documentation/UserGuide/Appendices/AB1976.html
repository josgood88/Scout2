<b>Title</b>: AB-1976 (Eggman) Mental health services: assisted outpatient treatment.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Summary</b>: (Reviewed 1/23/2020)
   <br />
   <br />The Assisted Outpatient Treatment Demonstration Project Act of 2002 is known as Laura's Law. 
         Current law authorizes counties to offer assisted outpatient treatment.
   <br />
   <br />The law was named after Laura Wilcox, a receptionist who was killed by a man who had refused psychiatric treatment. 
         On January 10, 2001, she and two other people were shot to death by Scott Harlan Thorpe, a 40-year-old man who resisted his family's 
         and a social worker's attempt to have him hospitalized when he became increasingly delusional and paranoid.
   <br />
   <br />From the legislative counsel's digest: This bill would require a county or group of counties to offer those mental health programs 
         unless a county opts out by a resolution passed by the governing body stating the reasons for opting out and any facts or circumstances relied on in making that decision.... The bill would also repeal the expiration of Laura's Law, thereby extending it indefinitely.
   <br />
   <br />Assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) is court-ordered treatment.
   <br />Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outpatient_commitment
   <br />From Wikipedia, "A judge orders an individual diagnosed with a severe mental disorder who is experiencing a psychiatric crisis that requires 
         intervention to adhere to an outpatient treatment plan designed to prevent further deterioration that is harmful to themselves or others."
   <br />
   <br />This is outpatient care, meaning that the patient continues to live in his/her community and is not confined to a psychiatric hospital. 
         Treatment typically consists of medication.
   <br />
   <br />Also from Wikipedia: "The psychiatric survivors movement opposes compulsory treatment on the basis that the ordered drugs 
         often have serious or unpleasant side-effects such as tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, 
         excessive weight gain leading to diabetes, addiction, sexual side effects, and increased risk of suicide.
   <br />
   <br />Definitions
   <br />Neuroleptic: An antipsychotic or anesthetic drug that causes apathy, lack of initiative, and limited range of emotion
   <br />Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: a life-threatening reaction that can occur in response to neuroleptic or antipsychotic medication. 
         Symptoms include high fever, confusion, rigid muscles, variable blood pressure, sweating, and fast heart rate.
   <br />Dyskinesia: an involuntary movement that you cannot control
   <br />Tardive: Having symptoms that develop slowly or appear long after inception. Used of a disease.
   <br />Tardive dyskinesia: A disorder that results in involuntary, repetitive body movements. 
         This may include grimacing, sticking out the tongue, or smacking the lips.

   <b>Position</b>: Oppose
   <br />Assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) moves psychiatry from locked wards to walk-in clinics. 
         Very dangerous expansion of psychiatry, moving psychiatry towards becoming a part of normal living.
</p>
<b>ShortSummary</b>: Laura's Law now opt-out, not opt-in.  Does not expire.
